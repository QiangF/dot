* example setup
1. environment variables are defined in: dotrc
2. $dotdir/$OS contains rules for dotfile manipulation and config script
3. dotfile manipulation rule file name pattern is "$DOT_COMMAND-$Operation"
4. DOT_COMMAND can be dots or sdots
* usage
in your bashrc
source ~/.dotfiles/dot/dotrc

* dotlink example
# https://github.com/ssh0/dotfiles/blob/master/dotlink
# script ignore commented out line
# and empty line
# Format:
# <dotfile>,<linkto>
#
# the script automatically add root directory to the file path.
# So, you should write like below:
myvimrc,.vimrc

# Then the script will make the symbolic link from `$DOT_DIR/myvimrc` to `$HOME/.vimrc`.
# The path start from slash "/" is correctly understood by the script:
# when symbolic link path start with /, it treated as the true path, $HOME is not prepended.

# And you can use environment variables in it.
# It is useful when the file contains some private information and
# you wouldn't upload it to your dotfiles repository.
$HOME/Dropbox/briefcase/netrc,.netrc
